# AWS VPC PROJECT
This is a repository to store my first AWS VPC project. The Objective is to Design and set up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with both public and private subnets. Implement routing, security groups, and network access control lists (NACLs) to ensure proper communication and security within the VPC. Work in the AWS EU-West-1 (Ireland) region.

# Task 1 - Create VPC
The first task is to create a VPC Named KCVPC with a CIDR block: 10.0.0.0/16.
